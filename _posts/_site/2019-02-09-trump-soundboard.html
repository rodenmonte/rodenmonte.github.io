<p>It’s easy to make android apps with <a href="https://cordova.apache.org">Cordova</a>,
a tool allowing developers to bundle any single page web app into
an android and ios application. I thought I’d test it out by making
a simple soundboard app. Here’s how it turned out:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/soundboard_screen_shot.png" style="width: 300px; height: 550px;     margin: 0 auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>Cordova simply embeds the application code into a WebView. For
applications as simple as this, performance gains from a native
implementation aren’t noticeable. I’m looking forward to saving
time in the future by writing my apps once and building
for multiple platforms with Cordova.</p>

<p>The soundboard client was writte in <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.
A framework really wasn’t needed for a web app this simple, but I
was interested in seeing I’d run into any difficulties in integrating
Vue.js with a webpack build into the Cordova environment – which I
thankfully did not.</p>
